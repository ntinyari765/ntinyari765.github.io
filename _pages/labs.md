## HTB Academy - Introduction to Network Traffic Analysis 
*Category: Network Security*

### Problem Statement
This module introduced me to the fundamentals of network traffic analysis, including how to capture, interpret, and examine network data using tools such as Wireshark and tcpdump. I learned how to analyze packet captures (PCAPs) to understand network communication patterns, identify anomalies, and detect potential security threats. The module also highlighted the importance of traffic analysis in cybersecurity, particularly in intrusion detection, troubleshooting, and forensic investigations. It gave me a practical perspective on how network data can be used for security monitoring and analysis.

### Approach
-Learn Protocols – HTTP, DNS, TCP/UDP, HTTPS
-Use Tools – Wireshark, tcpdump
-Analyze PCAPs – Filter traffic, spot anomalies.

### Tools Used
- tcpdump
- Wireshark

### Key Lessons Learned
This module covered network traffic analysis principles and discussed the implications for both blue team and red team personnel. I learnt Wireshark and tcpdump usage and the different ways to sniff out sensitive data on a network. I also got to understand general network traffic analysis solutions and the security implications of having no visibility into the network

## Packet Tracer - Build a Switch and Router Network 
*Category: Network Configuration*

### Problem Statement
This activity focused on reinforcing my understanding of IOS commands through practical application in a simulated network environment. I used Cisco Packet Tracer to build a simple network consisting of a Cisco router, a Cisco switch and two Windows PCs with terminals. I began by cabling the devices according to the topology diagram, then configured them using the addressing table. I practiced using the Command Line Interface (CLI) to enter and save configurations, and later verified network connectivity to ensure the setup was successful. I then used IOS commands to retrieve device information and answer questions about the network. 

### Approach
- Connected devices (router, switch, 2 PCs) per the diagram
- Applied IOS commands (enable, configure terminal) for CLI configuration
- Used ping/tracert to test connectivity

### Tools Used
- Packettracer

### Key Lessons Learned
In conclusion, this activity successfully strengthened my ability to configure and manage basic network devices using Cisco IOS commands. I gained practical experience in setting up a small network, assigning IP addresses, configuring switches and routers using CLI and testing connectivity between devices. Additionally, I learned how to retrieve important device information, which further deepened my familiarity with network operations and device management.
